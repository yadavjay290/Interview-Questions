Interview Questions- Create a list of number 1 to 10, create 2 empty list.L1=[]Â¶ L2=[] Create a program / function so that #L1 Even , L2 Odd Numbers.
create any dictionary with 4 key value pair.
print all the values of the dictionary as a list.

a= 10, b= 20, c= 15 #write a logic to check the smallest of the three df_dict = {'CUSTID': ['98981', '897892','32323','98900','98981'], 'CamapignID': ['C1', 'C2','C3','C1', 'C1'], 'Units Purchased':[2,1,7,4,2]}
make a dataframe df1 of this dictionary. #calclate the total units purchased for each CampaignID #Exclude c2 from df1 and then calclate the total units purchased for each CampaignID
